The National Education Policy 2020 (NEP 2020) is a game changer for India's education system. It stresses a transition away from rote learning and toward a more holistic and skill-based approach, giving graduates the capabilities they need to prosper in the dynamic labor market of the twenty-first century. <br /> <br /> NEP 2020's key elements for ensuring holistic individual development include learning outcome-based education, a focus on critical thinking and problem solving, multidisciplinary learning, multiple entry-exit points, value-based development, and more.
Our industry-integrated undergraduate and postgraduate programs in sectors like as management, healthcare, and information technology are painstakingly crafted to meet NEP criteria. NSVE is in the forefront of integrating past learning to professional growth through formal education, in accordance with the standards of the National Credit Framework (NCrF) and the National Higher Education Qualification Framework.
