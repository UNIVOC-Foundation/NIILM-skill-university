        "ducation is light and illiteracy is darkness. As an educationist, it is my bounden duty to spread the light of wisdom over the gloomy terrain of illiteracy. Education distinguishes a human from inhuman. Illiteracy is a curse and literacy is a grace leading one to self-realization. The Human being is a superb creation of nature representing the micro cosmos of the universe. In a way, he or she can be termed as a full-fledged universe endowed with invaluable treasures, which needs to be explored as a justification for its existence. Whatever is offered by nature to mankind is for research and exploration. The more you go deep down, the greater shall be your achievements. ",

        "As Swami Vivekananda explained, the basic objective of the education is mental, moral, and physical development. So you need to assess yourselves in this perspective and take corrective measures, if required, to imbibe those virtues in you. This is how you can be a noble personality to ameliorate the overall interest and the cause of society.",

        "Exams improve the students’ overall personality, memory, cognition and revision skills. Generally, students give oral and written exams in their schools/colleges. They have a wrong belief that an exam is unnecessary activity and fatigue, but if they try to think in a thoroughly positive way, they can understand the benefits of exams.My best wishes for those who seek to be a part of this University which is on the mission to strive towards the holistic development by looking in to the innovative student-teacher learning environment which endeavors excellence!",

        "It is a privilege to be the Ombudsperson at NIILM University, Kaithal. It is an exciting time for me to have joined the university. Although I started in this role in January -2023, in a very short time I’ve been inspired by the students, administrative leaders, staff and faculty I have met. I have heard many stories from students about ongoing challenges – including challenges with online learning, academic integrity matters, fee appeals, issues of privacy, and the requirement to attest to their vaccination status.",

        "I truly understand the importance, and sometimes the complexity, of ensuring procedural fairness and natural justice. One of my goals will be to continue the work of the Office of the Ombudsperson to advocate for fairness and to strive for greater clarity regarding university policies and procedures and greater transparency with respect to the decision-making process underlying these policies and procedures. Transparency is fundamental to procedural fairness because it ensures greater accountability. It also increases clarity and consistency in decision making.",
